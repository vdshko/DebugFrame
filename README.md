# DebugFrame

DebugFrame lib - a simple and powerful tool that can help you build your SwiftUI views easily.

Under the hood it's a modifier that can be applied to any SwiftUI view. It adds an overlay to your view, which displays a border around the view, along with frame information, such as the viewâ€™s origin and size. This can be incredibly helpful when trying to identify layout issues, such as views that are too large or small or views that are positioned incorrectly.

## Integration

#### Setup with SPM:

`DebugFrame` or `https://github.com/vdshko/DebugFrame`

#### Setup with CocoaPods:
