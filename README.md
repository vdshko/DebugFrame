# DebugFrame

DebugFrame lib is a simple and powerful tool that can help you build your SwiftUI views easily.

- Under the hood, it's a modifier that can be applied to any SwiftUI view. It adds an overlay to your view, which displays a border around the view and frame information, such as the viewâ€™s origin and size. This can be incredibly helpful when identifying layout issues, such as views that are too large or small or views that are positioned incorrectly.

- Another feature is a debugBackground extension for the View, with a randomly picked Color each re-render time.

## Integration
